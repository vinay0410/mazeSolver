# Theta mazes

Solver 1 solves circular mazes without markers or checkpoints which are supposed to be traversed, following is the set of maze and solution for it

Whereas, Solver 2 solves mazes while traversing one of the marker present between the origin and destination path, such that the path therefore traversed is the shortest, Following is an example
